      `**What Is Vishing?**<br><br>Vishing, or voice phishing, is a type of social engineering attack where scammers use phone calls to trick you into giving up confidential information or taking harmful actions.`,
      `**Why Should You Care?**<br><br>Vishing scams can lead to data breaches, financial fraud, and identity theft. They often sound convincing and target everyday employees — not just tech experts.`,
      `**How to Protect Yourself**<br><br>
      • Never give sensitive info over the phone without verifying the caller.<br>
      • Always confirm requests with a known contact.<br>
      • Be cautious of urgent or emotional language used to pressure you.`,
      `**Example Scenario**<br><br>
      A caller claims to be from IT and urgently needs your password to fix a network issue. They say if you don't cooperate, your account will be locked. You feel rushed — but this is a trap. Always verify their identity using official contacts before acting.`,
